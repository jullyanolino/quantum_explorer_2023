# Quantum Explorer 2023
Quantum Explorers is our self-paced, game-based quantum computing learning program for high school students and above. The theme of the learning journey is space exploration. Youâ€™ll embark on an interstellar journey as the captain of a starship and grow proficiency in quantum computing along the way.

Anyone can join, from students to industry professionals to quantum enthusiasts! The program is beginner-friendly, though it increases in difficulty as achievements are unlocked. The program is comprised of engaging study materials, seminars, gamified achievements to unlock, community events, and career advice.

Participants will gain a general understanding of quantum computing, learn some of its applications such as quantum machine learning and quantum optimization, and program real quantum computers.

There are seven themed achievements to unlock with corresponding badges to collect. Each badge has a learning module, event, or set of tasks associated with it that must be completed in order to unlock its achievement. The program culminates in a certification based on how many badges you collect.
